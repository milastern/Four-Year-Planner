# William & Mary Four-Year Plan Generator

## Overview

The **William & Mary Four-Year Plan Generator** is a web application built with **Dash**, designed to help students create personalized four-year academic plans based on their major, minor, language preferences, study-abroad options, and academic credits. This tool is highly customizable to accommodate different degree types such as single major, double major, or major with a minor. The generated plan includes a chart that visually represents the student's course schedule for the chosen degree path.

## Features

- **Select Primary Major**: Choose a primary major from a list of available options.
- **Credits Input**: Enter the number of credits already earned.
- **Language Preference**: Select a language for the foreign language proficiency and for international relations majors.
- **Study Abroad Options**: Indicate if the student plans to study abroad during their academic career.
- **Degree Type**: Choose from single major, double major, or major-minor configurations.
- **Dynamic Field Visibility**: Depending on the selected degree type, the app will show or hide additional fields like secondary major and minor selections.
- **Personalized Four-Year Plan**: Upon submitting the form, the app generates a course schedule and displays it as an image.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the William & Mary Four-Year Plan Generator, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Packages

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/four-year-plan-generator.git
cd four-year-plan-generator
```
Create and activate a virtual environment. If you use uv, it's as simple as:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```
Then, install the project dependencies using the pyproject.toml file:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

This will install all the necessary libraries, including Dash, matplotlib, and others that are used in the app.

# 2. Data Setup

Ensure that the required data files are in place:

- **majors_list.npy**: A list of available majors.
- **minors_list.npy**: A list of available minors.
- **majors.npy**: A dictionary of the major requirements for the avalible majors 
- **minors.npy**: A dictionary of the minor requirements for the avalible minors
-**course_catalog.npy**: A list of information on all avalable courses


These files should be placed in a folder named `data` in the root of the project directory. These files can be generated by running `course_catalog.py` or `majors_n_minors` in the `data_prep` folder if for some reason they are missing. 

# 3. Running the Application

After installing the dependencies and setting up the data, you can run the application:

```python
python main.py 
```

This will start the Dash server and you can access the app by opening your browser and navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

# Using the Application

- **Open the app**: When the app is running, open your browser and go to the local server URL: [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/).
- **Enter Your Information**: Fill out the form with the following details:
- **Submit the Form**: Once you have filled in the form, click the "Submit" button to generate your four-year plan.
- **View the Plan**: After submitting, a personalized course schedule will appear as a visual chart representing your four-year plan.

# Code Structure

The code structure of this project is organized to separate steps of the scheduling process, making it easy to understand. Each component of the program is designed for a specific role, from user interaction to schedule generation and data handling.

## 1. **main.py**
   - This is the main entry point for the application and the file that runs the Dash server. It is responsible for setting up the web server.
    
## 2. **src/ui_program.py**
   - **Role**: Contains the code for the Dash application, including layout and interactive components.
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Dash Layout**: This file defines the structure of the user interface using Dash components (`html.Div`, `dcc.Dropdown`, `dcc.Input`, etc.). The layout consists of various sections, such as the introduction, input fields for user data, and dynamic display components.
     - **User Inputs**: The UI includes fields for selecting a primary major, entering credits, selecting a language, and determining study abroad preferences. These fields guide the user through creating a personalized four-year plan.
    

## 3. **src/get_courses.py**
   - **Role**: Contains the `make_a_schedule` class, which performs all core scheduling logic based on user input.

    - **Overview of `make_a_schedule` Methods**:

    - `clean_course_data(self)`: Prepares and cleans course data before scheduling.

    - `get_unmet_prereqs(self)`: Identifies which prerequisite courses are still required for a given course.

    - `add_course(self, course)`: Adds a single course to the schedule.

    - `get_minor_courses(self)`: Retrieves required courses for the selected minor.

    - `get_major_classes(self)`: Retrieves required courses for the selected major(s).

    - `add_coll_classes(self)`: Adds general COLL classes to the schedule.

    - `add_abroad(self)`: Inserts study abroad semesters and adjusts scheduling accordingly.

    - `add_any_electives(self)`: Fills remaining credit requirements with elective courses.

    - `compile(self)`: Compiles the entire course list across semesters into a unified format.

    - `sort_schedule(self)`: Orders courses chronologically and logically across the four years.

    - `make_schedule(self)`: Generates the full semester-by-semester schedule in dictionary form.

    - `make_chart(self, output: str = None)`: Generates a chart for visualizing the schedule.


   

## 4. **data/**
   - **Role**: The `data` folder contain files that store lists of majors, minors, and other academic options, which the app uses to populate dropdowns and generate a schedule.
   - **Files**:
     - **`majors_list.npy`**: A NumPy file containing a list of available majors at the institution. This is used to generate the list of majors for the dropdown menus in the app. 

     - **`majors.npy`**: A NumPy file containing a list of all available majors at the institution and their requirements. This is used for creating cirriculums for primary and secondary majors 

     - **`minors_list.npy`**: A NumPy file containing a list of available minors at the institution. It is used to for the minor dropdown if the user selects a major-minor degree type.

     - **`minors.npy`**: A NumPy file containing a list of all available minors at the institution and their requirements. This is used for creating cirriculums for minors

  

   ## 5. **data_prep/**
- `course_catalog.py`:
  - **Purpose**: Web scraper that extracts course data from the William & Mary online course catalog.
  - **Output**: Provides structured data used by `get_courses.py`.
- `majors_n_minors.py`:
  - **Purpose**: Stores hardcoded requirement dictionaries for the 10 most popular William & Mary majors and minors.
  - **Output**: Provides structured data used by `get_courses.py`.
  - **Use**: Referenced by `make_a_schedule` to determine required classes. 

  ## 6 **assets/**
- Stores static assets for the Dash app.
- **Notably includes** the PNG output of the userâ€™s generated four-year schedule.
